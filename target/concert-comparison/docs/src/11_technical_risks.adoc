== Risks and Technical Debts

=== High Traffic Overload

- **Description**: During the release of tickets for highly anticipated concerts, the system may experience a sudden surge in user traffic. If the system is not designed to handle such peak loads, it could become unresponsive or crash, leading to a poor user experience and loss of sales.

- **Mitigation**: Implement a scalable cloud infrastructure, and thorough performance testing to ensure the system can handle high volumes of traffic.

=== Double-Selling of Seats:

- **Description**: When multiple users attempt to purchase the same seat simultaneously, there is a risk that the system might allocate the same seat to more than one user. This can lead to customer dissatisfaction and logistical issues during the event.

- **Mitigation**: Implement a WebSockets-based real-time seat locking mechanism to prevent double-selling of seats.

=== Payment Processing Failures:

- **Description**: Errors or delays in payment processing can result in failed transactions or duplicate charges. This can frustrate users and lead to a loss of revenue as well as potential disputes and chargebacks.

- **Mitigation**: Ensure integration with reliable payment gateways and implement thorough error handling and transaction verification processes.
