== Introduction and Goals

The objectives of this architectural kata are to design a solution for a concert ticketing site that is:

- **Robust**: Capable of handling failures gracefully.
- **Scalable**: Able to manage high volumes of traffic, particularly during peak periods when tickets go on sale.

- **Ensure not Double selling**: Guarantee that no seat is sold more than once, even under high load conditions.
- **Real-Time Seat Overview**: Offer shoppers a real-time view of available seats, updating dynamically as seats are purchased.
- **Elastic Scalability**: Enable the system to scale up or down automatically based on traffic demand, ensuring optimal resource utilization.

=== Quality Goals

- **Scalability**: 
- **Performance**: 
- **Reliability**:
