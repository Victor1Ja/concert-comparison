== Introduction and Goals

The objectives of this architectural kata are to design a solution for a concert ticketing site that is:

- **Robust**: Capable of handling failures gracefully.
- **Scalable**: Able to manage high volumes of traffic, particularly during peak periods when tickets go on sale.
- **Secure**: Protects user data and prevents unauthorized access.

The system must meet the following goals:

- Buy tickets for a concert.
- Prevent the double-selling of seats.
- Provide a real-time overview of remaining seats to users.

=== Requirements Overview

- **Buy Tickets**: Allow users to purchase tickets for a concert.
- **Ensure not Double selling**: Guarantee that no seat is sold more than once, even under high load conditions.
- **Real-Time Seat Overview**: Offer shoppers a real-time view of available seats, updating dynamically as seats are purchased.
- **Secure Transactions**: Protect user data and ensure that transactions are secure.


=== Quality Goals

- **Scalability**: The system must be able to handle high volumes of traffic, particularly during peak periods when tickets go on sale.
- **Integrity**: The system must maintain a valid state, considering that multiple users may try to purchase the same seat at the same time.
- **Performance**: The system must be fast and responsive, providing a smooth user experience.
- **Maintainability**: The system must be easy to maintain and update.
- **Flexibility**: The system must be able to adapt to changing requirements and business needs.
