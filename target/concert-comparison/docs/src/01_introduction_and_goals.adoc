== Introduction and Goals

The objectives of this architectural kata are to design a solution for a concert ticketing site that is:

- **Robust**: Capable of handling failures gracefully.
- **Scalable**: Able to manage high volumes of traffic, particularly during peak periods when tickets go on sale.
- **Secure**: Protects user data and prevents unauthorized access.

The system must meet the following goals:

- **Real-Time Seat Overview**: Offer shoppers a real-time view of available seats, updating dynamically as seats are purchased.
- **Secure Transactions**: Protect user data and ensure that transactions are secure.


=== Quality Goals

- **Scalability**: The system must be able to handle high volumes of traffic, particularly during peak periods when tickets go on sale.
- **Performance**: The system must be fast and responsive, providing a smooth user experience.
