== Cross-cutting Concepts





=== Security

Security involves protecting the system from unauthorized access, data breaches, and other threats. This encompasses authentication, authorization, encryption, and auditing mechanisms to ensure the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of data. Robust security is crucial to protect sensitive user information and transaction data.

=== Scalability

Scalability refers to the ability of the system to handle increased load by adding resources. This concept ensures that the system can accommodate growing numbers of users and transactions, particularly during peak times.

=== Performance

Performance involves the responsiveness and efficiency of the system. It includes aspects like response time, throughput, and resource utilization. In a ticketing system, high performance ensures that users can quickly view seats availability and complete transactions without delays, even under high load conditions.

=== Reliability

Reliability ensures that the system consistently performs its intended functions correctly. A reliable ticketing system minimizes downtime and ensures that users can purchase tickets without interruption.

=== Real-Time Processing

Real-time processing involves the system's ability to process data and provide immediate feedback. In the context of a ticketing system, this means instantly updating seat availability and confirming transactions. Real-time processing is crucial for preventing double-selling and providing a seamless user experience.

=== Concurrency

Concurrency involves managing multiple operations at the same time without conflicts. This is critical in a ticketing system where many users might attempt to purchase the same seat simultaneously. Effective concurrency control ensures data integrity and prevents issues like double-selling of seats.

=== Transaction Management

Transaction management ensures that all operations within a transaction are completed successfully or none at all. This is crucial for maintaining data consistency and integrity, especially in financial transactions like purchasing tickets.
